# Classification-of-Fruits-using-Fuzzy-Logic

Data set – Fruits 360 (  Kaggle )

Libraries used  - Glob , cv2 , numpy , os  , pandas , sklearn , csv

# Fruits Considered

1.Apple

2.Banana

3.Kiwi

4.Orange 

While implementing the decision tree we will go through the following two phases:

1.Building Phase 

2.Operational Phase

# 1. Building Phase
        
        ◦ Pre process the data set.
        
        ◦ Split the data set from train and test using Python 		sklearn package.
        
        ◦ Train the classifier.

 # 2. Operational Phase
 
        ◦ Make predictions.

# Procedure

1.Select fruit image

2.Find the Contours & Crop the fruit area  

3.Compute mean for RGB components .

4.Compute shape by threshold segmentation (remove noises, morphological operations) 

5.Compute geometrical properties (Area, perimeter) 

6.Use Decision Tree Classifier and parameters in 3, 4, 5 to classify the image 

7.Output Result
